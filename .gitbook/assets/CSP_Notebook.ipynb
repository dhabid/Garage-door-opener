    "### **Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "CSPs (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) are precisely algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems. That is, a certain search problem has several possible ways of reaching the solution, but in this case, with a CSP, the search for the solution will be based on a set of user-defined constraints. The algorithm will use the constraints with a heuristic (guide) to reach a desired solution more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSP contains the following key components in order to function:\n",
    "1. **Set of Variables** - The variables are a set of parameters that are particularly important to the problem. For example, in the Sudoku problem, the variables would be the positions on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set of Domains** - The domains or domain is the set of options that the variables can take in the problem. Using Sudoku again as an example, the domain would be the set of possible values from 0 to 9 for each position on the grid (variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set of Constraints** - The constraints are therefore the set of information that the algorithm has to fulfill in order to conclude with a solution. In the case of Sudoku, the constraints are the rules of the game, namely that the sum of the rows, columns and diagonals of each division of the grid adds up to 9. There is also a division between Soft Constraints and Hard Constraints which defines that Soft constraints are optional, while Hard constraints are mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various approaches to solving search problems with CSPs, but there are three types that are most commonly used:\n",
    "1. Arc-Consistency Algorithm (AC-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Backtracking Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Min-Conflits\n",

    "For this project, the challenge is to define timetables for classes in a school, satisfying a set of requirements. This problem demonstrates one of the many real applications of CSP's and here we will be encouraged to apply the concepts covered in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, the following timetable template has been defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Timetable Template](images/Horário_template.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen, therefore, that the timetable offers the possibility of classes from Monday to Friday, where each day has 4 possible blocks of classes. Therefore, each day a subject can be taught in the 9-11am, 11-13am, 2-4pm and 4-6pm blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the timetable, there are a number of requirements that have been imposed: \n",
    "* Each class lasts 2 hours and they all take place during the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All classes have 4 to 10 lessons a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class should not have more than 3 lessons a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class should not have more than 4 days of lessons per week (one day free).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only 1 or 2 lessons per morning/afternoon can be taught.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](images/image-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After the requirements, there are also a number of preferences that can be implemented if possible:\n",
    "* Each class should have the majority of lessons in the same room.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Teachers may have a preference for timetables (availability).\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this, the aim will be to find timetables for each class that meet the above requirements and whose solution has the fewest holes. In other words, solutions will be more valuable if the number of trips to school for each class and the number of rooms used are minimized. This will require additional constraints to make the problem more realistic."

    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will start by choosing the Platform that will be used to solve the schedules. That is, the library responsible for processing CSPs will be chosen. There are several projects available in this field, but two libraries have attracted the most attention due to their popularity and versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Aima-Python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python): This was the professor's initial recommendation. The github repository associated with the library has lots of examples in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and also contains some CSP examples. The project has good documentation, an active community and is also easy to use. However, it can be a little slow for complex applications such as our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Python-Constraint](https://github.com/python-constraint/python-constraint): A simpler library than the previous one, which only contains CSPs. The API (Application Programming Interface) is simpler and contains most of the CSP algorithms, but not AC-3. The documentation is not as in-depth as its predecessor and the community support is more stagnant over time. The big advantage is essentially the speed of processing. This means that this library is more optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of library was difficult, but after several tests, it was concluded that Python-Constraint would be the best choice, as it solved the problems in considerably less time. That said, it also makes sense to give some credit to the authors of the library for the simplicity of the API and the ease of invoking it. Whereas aima-python required several installation steps, this library comes all in one *PIP* package.\n",

    "To use the python-constraint library, and this notebook in general, you will need the following tools:\n",
    "1. **Python** - As you would expect, you will need Python installed on your machine in order to use code from this language. The library's documentation doesn't make it 100% clear which versions of Python are supported, but we recommend using Python 3.9 or 3.10. Generally, you should use versions close to the most recent, but never the most recent as it may be in a \"testing phase\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code editor** - To program in a certain language, a code editor is usually used. The platforms normally used for python are Pycharm, Visual Studio and VS code. VS code was used in this situation because of its versatility and ease of use. This tool has a convenient function that allows you to \"push\" changes directly to the github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Virtual Environment** - This requirement is optional. A virtual environment dedicated to this work can only be distinguished from other installations carried out in the base environment. The most commonly used platform is Anaconda, which allows the creation of virtual environments that support python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Jupyter Notebook** - You need to have the Jupyter Notebook extension installed on your text editing platform to access a well-organized view of your work. Jupyter allows you to switch between text cells in Markdown and code cells (python). This allows you to follow the code directly with comments and explanations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The installation procedures are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python** - You can install version 3.9.13 from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/). On the site, look below and click on \"Windows installer (64 bit)\", which is the recommended installation. After downloading, you should follow the *Wizzard* installation steps, and at the end you should click on \"Add python to path\", as in the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image-4.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Code editor** - There are plenty of code editor options, but if you're interested in Vs Code, the following [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) takes you to its installation page. All you have to do is select your machine's operating system, download the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Anaconda** - Anaconda is the best-known virtual environment platform and is therefore recommended. To install Anaconda there is the following [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads). At the bottom of the site you will see the Operating System options. You should proceed in the same way as with the previous installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebook** - jupyter can be installed as an extension of Vs code. Simply click on \"Extensions\" in the left-hand panel or \"Control + Shift + X\" and type \"Jupyter Notebook\" into the search bar. It should install the first search result.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. Each class only has a maximum of 3 classes per day.\n",
    "2. There is a free day for each class.\n",

The two tables at the bottom left represent the teachers' teaching each week for both classes and also the use of rooms throughout the week. After collecting the information, it was concluded that no teacher teaches two subjects simultaneously or the same room is used at the same time."

    "In this work, we address the creation of school schedules using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in the context of the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence discipline. The main objective was to implement an algorithm that solved the problem of defining schedules for classes in a school, applying the concepts learned about CSPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by introducing CSPs, highlighting their essential concepts, such as variables, domains and restrictions. Next, we present the specific problem of defining class schedules, detailing the associated requirements and preferences. The choice of the Python-Constraint library for practical implementation was justified based on its efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical implementation covered preparing the environment, including the Python-Constraint library, defining variables, initializing the problem and formulating the constraints. We detail the different solution algorithms, such as Backtracking, Recursive Backtracking and Min Conflicts Solver, opting for the latter due to its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the theoretical phase, we move on to practical application, creating real timetables for IPCA Electrical Engineering and Computers classes. We consider different sets of subjects, teachers, rooms and define a set of constraints that reflect real-world challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing the work involved visualizing the results, displaying the schedules created by the algorithm for each class. We highlight the importance of restrictions in guaranteeing the validity and realism of the solutions obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this work provided a practical and meaningful application of CSPs in solving complex problems, showing how these concepts can be useful in optimizing real-world processes, such as preparing school schedules."
