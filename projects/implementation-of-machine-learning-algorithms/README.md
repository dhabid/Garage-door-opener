# Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms

## Introduction

This project consists of implementing solutions to different problems using machine learning algorithms (_machine learning - ML_). The project is divided into two themes:

* **Supervised Learning:** Three automatic classification methods (**K-NN**, **Decision Tree,** and **Random Forest**) will be presented to solve a specific problem using the same database. The objective is to convey the usefulness of these methods for a more real problem and obtain important knowledge in this field.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** In this second part, two different problems will be presented on the same database, one of which will be solved using the _clustering_ **K-Means** method and the other will be solved with association rules and the **Apriori** algorithm. The objective of this part is also to implement the use of these algorithms for more realistic situations and also to obtain some experience in the field.
